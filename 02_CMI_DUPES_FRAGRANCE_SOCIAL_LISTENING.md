## EXAMPLES: HOW BRANDS ADDRESS THE DUPE PHENOMENON

### Subtle Reinforcement (MFK Approach)
*Very subtle for niche/ultra-premium, relying on influencers rather than directly addressing topic*

**Maison Francis Kurkdjian - Baccarat Rouge 540:**
> "MARCHAND DE BONHEUR. Au cœur d'un Paris féerique, Baccarat Rouge 540 marque de son empreinte inimitable et révèle une signature olfactive graphique et condensée à l'extrême. Intensément Rouge, le fabuleux Extrait de Parfum marque par son sillage hors-norme et hautement addictif."

### Unapologetically Bold Communication (Charlotte Tilbury Approach)
*Clear communication, leveraging fame and trendiness to highlight why they're the best and why they're being duped*

**Charlotte Tilbury:**
> "LEGENDARY. FOR A REASON.
>
> I have bottled over 30 years of artistry + expertise in my backstage beauty icons! Developed with world-leading scientists, my award-winning makeup + skincare formulas give you the Tilbury Feeling – making you look + feel like the most beautiful, confident version of you!
>
> From my GLOBALLY-LOVED Magic Cream to the ORIGINAL confidence glow booster, my viral Hollywood Flawless Filter, and my VIRAL Beauty Light Wands, I love to see how my LEGENDARY ICONS have changed people's lives around the world!
>
> There's a reason why they are STAPLE ICONS in every CELEBRITY RED CARPET CLUTCH + in EVERY MAKEUP ARTIST'S KIT! **It's magic that CANNOT be duped, darlings!**
>
> 🔷 THE ORIGINAL! THE ONE + ONLY! THE UNDUPABLE! 🔷"
