## USAGE GUIDELINES:

### FOR TEAMS SELF-EVALUATING:

1. **Score honestly** - inflated scores hurt your development
2. **Identify gaps early** - iterate before submission
3. **Focus on Tier 2** - L'Oréal alignment often overlooked but critical
4. **Don't ignore Tier 4** - dupe immunity is competitive advantage
5. **Balance tiers** - aim for 80%+ across ALL tiers (not just Tier 1)

### FOR JUDGES EVALUATING:

1. **Start with Tier 1** (official criteria) - must meet competition standards
2. **Then assess Tier 2** - L'Oréal DNA fit predicts internal support
3. **Evaluate Tier 3** - market potential predicts real-world success
4. **Finally Tier 4** - defensibility predicts longevity

**WINNING INNOVATIONS:** Strong across ALL FOUR TIERS (not just high Tier 1).

### FOR STRATEGIC DECISIONS:

**If choosing between two projects:**
- **Project A:** Tier 1: 45, Tier 2: 60, Tier 3: 35, Tier 4: 25 = **165 total**
- **Project B:** Tier 1: 40, Tier 2: 85, Tier 3: 42, Tier 4: 38 = **205 total**

**Choose Project B:** Lower official score but MUCH stronger L'Oréal alignment, market fit, and defensibility. More likely to win AND succeed in market.
