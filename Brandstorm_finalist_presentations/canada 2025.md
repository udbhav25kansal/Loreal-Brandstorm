It's team Canada. \>\> All right, team Canada. This is your Swifty era. It \>\> is. \>\> Show us your vision. Take it away. \>\> Here we go. \>\> Hey, Ken. Do you remember when we were kids? If we scraped our knee, we'd run straight to our mom. She would slap on a band-aid and boom, healed. But now, when something hurts here, \>\> men are silent, \>\> acting as if their minds aren't a part of their bodies at all. Out of all the men who suffers from anxiety in the US, only 5% of them will

00:01:01  
seek treatment. The reason stigma. The same stigma that tells men that self-care is not for them. \>\> Here's the thing. Something's shifting. Men have increased their focus on wellness and brands are waking up to the fact that men want in, but they need the right entry point. And that's where you, L'Oreal, comes in. Because if stigma stops men from seeking help out there, let's give them a solution in here. Something private, powerful, built into what they already need and want.

Introducing Garnier Men Revive, a line of wellness body washes that turns your daily showers into a mindful reset. Traditional body washes may offer a scent, but Revive delivers a sciencebacked sensory reset using aroma therapy that targets our emotional nervous system because stress and anxiety triggers information. Your skin reflects your state of mind, and we're here to flip the script. Studies show men are more responsive to aroma therapy than women. We're unlocking a new side of personalized wellness for men with

00:02:13  
the aroma therapy mark is set to double by 2034\. Why isn't L'Oreal in the space yet? \>\> Three washes, three emotions, three experiences, and no one else is doing it. Take Recharge for the days your brain is offline after long hours of work when you need a reset and not just a rinse. An energizing gel with essential oils and ingredients to boost focus and fight fatigue. And here is what set us apart. Every bottle is a tool, not just a wash. With thermocchromic ink that shifts color

00:02:45  
when the water gets too hot for men's skin, and a builtin roller guided by acupressure maps aimed to alleviate stress and some tension. \>\> L'Oreal, you've led in clinical sciences, dermatology, tech. Now it's time to lead a more quieter, deeper revolution built on softer practices that have always worked but never reached a bigger scale. \>\> And others, they're coming up with more sense, more labels in the same old function. But no one is offering an experience. And that's the gap. That's

00:03:19  
where we win. So Ken, when something does hurt here, well, I'll start with Garnier men revive. \>\> That's the shift. Garnier reset. Revive. Repeat. Let's make it happen. \>\> Well done, team Canada. \[Applause\]
