Welcome to the the stage team Malaysia. \>\> Hello. Hello. Hello. \>\> Push a little bit this way. The other way. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. I love the t-shirts. Beardsmiths. Okay. Are you ready, team beardsmiths? Yes, of course. \>\> Okay, your three minutes. One, two, three, go. \[Music\] \>\> Having a patchy beard has made me insecure several times. \>\> Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder why my beard just won't grow in properly. \>\> I've tried taking supplements, oils, and

00:00:52  
even massaged my face as if it owed me hair. Results still patchy. \>\> Cross cultures. A beard means something powerful. A tradition in Saudi, style in Germany, and pride in India. But what if the beard grows patchy? The struggle is real. And guess what? I have that problem, too. \>\> Well, don't worry, Vishua. I've got just the right solution for you. Let me introduce to you Flashbeard Patch. The world's first AI powered self-heating patch made from 100% recycled materials.

Wo\! How does it work? First, you have to insert the serum cartridge into the device. Then scan your face using the Flashbeard AI app to identify patchy spots. The app will then determine the treatment parameters. The patch inside will then heat up accordingly to stimulate hair follicles and also generate microcurrens to wake up those lazy beard roots. \>\> Wait, are you trying to say it's like giving a shock to wake up my beard roots? Exactly. Plus, the patch also releases growth serums through its micro

00:02:01  
needles directly into your skin. So, no mess, no greasy face, all handsree. So, I just stick it on my face, let it go for 5 minutes, and boom, boom, beard growth begins. Let's go. Finally, a patch that turns baby face into beard face. The judges, we are tapping into a 3.4 4 billion market led by Europe the alpha of beard care followed by India and Middle East where beard is constant more than just hair. So our GTM plan starts strong with phase one digital search retail at our media platform

00:02:31  
specifically to each region meeting men exactly where they scroll search and shop. Phase two introducing mercy pop-up boots in hight traffic malls and campuses. Why? Because 86% of men trust a product more after using it. So phase three is where conversion begins going all out through online sales. But what makes us different is we don't only target the big players like Amazon but also dive deeper targeting small players who specializes in grooming. Phase four going into offline sales targeting

00:02:59  
hypermarkets and beard grooming stores. So we selling your device at €39 which acts as our main customer recruiter and our cartridge at 9\. But the real engine of loyalty lies within the different type of cartridges we offer all approved by the methodologist. So judges, if we play this game right, we're able to hit a revenue on nearly €900 million by year three. \>\> Judges, keeping all of this in your mind, we are not just trying to sell a patch. We're trying to unlock something much more deeper.

00:03:26
