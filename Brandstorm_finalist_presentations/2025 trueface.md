I'd like to introduce you to team Czecha, Hungary, Slovakia, Hub. \>\> Okay, this is your moment. Ready, set, go. \>\> Hello, my name is Matthew and I don't use any skin care. There's just so many products. It makes my hands feel dirty and it isn't fun at all. When I try to make a habit of it, the habit doesn't last to me. The product I want is a 15in one to use once per year. But is this really the best solution? We have the revolutionary gadget that you need. So basically a ball inside the ring.

00:01:26  
Yeah, that is Forcephere. First ever skincare device where playing a game is how you take care of your skin. You're literally improving your face while competing with your friends. And every game you play adapts to your skin's needs. That's because Forsphere is an ecosystem built on existing L'Oreal tech like Modify for facial diagnostics. The device is durable with a lifelong cycle and it's recyclable and the capsules are biodedegradable filled with existing men expert products. So it's

00:02:00  
hygienic and it's easily swappable. But what about the promo Ka? \>\> Well, let's launch in Europe as it's the market with the biggest upside. Think mass media, cross channel campaigns, and also bold advocacy voices from gaming, tech, and sport. and that will definitely drive reach. Winning starts with you is not just a moto for this team and will bring it through life through sponsorships and bold orb activations. The enabler kits sold via top online retailers and the capsules that carry the most profit will be sold

00:02:33  
online through drugstores or supermarket chains. \>\> But wait, there's more. Sports and pop culture collectibles will turn users into fans. and talk about inclusive because Foresere is truly for everyone no matter your gender, age or skin type. \>\> Skincare has the highest potential of all the beauty all the men beauty markets. We want to bring new consumers to the market when letting them who they are and we want to help achieve 18% of global market share. We want to be selling 63 million of the enable units

00:03:06  
per year and generate 1.2 2 billion in gross margin to L'Oreal. \>\> We are team True Face and this is Forphere, \>\> a revolution in men's skin care built to make Loyal number one in yet another category. \[Applause\]
