uess it's team South Korea. \>\> Team South Korea, the stage is yours. Your three minutes begin now. Meet Harry. One day he wakes up and notices a bald spot. He has a big meeting later that day, so he panics, rushes to the drugstore, and buys some darkening powder. It works until he starts sweating in the packed subway, ink trickling down his forehead. Harry misses his meeting. Wanting a solution, he turns to hair transplants only to learn that they can cost as much as $15,000. Permanent scalp tattoos just as

00:00:59  
expensive and they hurt a lot. To make matters worse, both require multiple meetings with a trained professional, which Harry just doesn't have the time for. Harry's bald spot grows along with his frustration. 95% of men experience male pattern baldness at some point of their lives. This means Harry's story can be your friends, your brothers, and yours. But now let's rewind and imagine what if upon entering that drugstore, Harry had the option to buy Karee. Karee is our henna inspired temporary sculpt

00:01:36  
tattooing device that will be launching under a new category called sculpt styling within L'Oreal Paris. It's designed for millions of men just like Harry for men in their early to mid-stages of male pattern baldness who don't have a solution that truly works for them. Using our device is extremely simple. First, you remove the lid, insert the cartridge, dot a vacant area on your scalp, wait for 10 minutes until you can wash off the ink, and voila, you're set for the day. Worried you'll

00:02:05  
make a mistake? No problem. Just make sure to erase the ink within the first 10 minutes, and then you'll be able to start fresh. Although our ink is made to last 1 to two weeks, we suggest a reapplication cycle of four to 5 days for the most natural results. If your ink ever runs out, you'll be able to purchase a refill at Laurel's website or at the nearest drugstore. And our vegan sculpt nourishing ink comes in 20 different shades that align with L'Oreal's Excelon steel clim. And this

00:02:38  
allows users to utilize the pre-existing virtual tryon system to find their perfect shade. And in terms of Takeare, we'll be having an even upgraded VTO system that allows users to find their perfect hairline and apply Takeare in a seamless manner. And all this for only $40 US, device and ink cartridge combined. So to all the hairies out there, if you're ever looking for a solution that you can trust, a solution you can afford, and most importantly, a solution that will make you hairy again, this is

00:03:15  
for you. \>\> Take control, take confidence, take care with take care. \>\> Thank you. \[Applause\]
