00:20:25  
who will give us our lineup order for the presentations and let us know who will go first now is the moment to find out which team will be the first one to present in front of our executive jury the first team to compete on this year's final is \[Music\] team iris from representing adria hello ladies so you'll be going first you picked number one you chose the trophy during uh the semi-final that was number one so you'll be going first for your presentations to our executive jury so get ready for your

00:21:19  
three minute pitch and we'll see you right after that for the qna session ladies the floor is yours best of luck thank you we are so happy to see you we are team iris from creation we would like to present iris mobile makeup a mobile app and makeup collection from an early age we are thought to express ourselves to various forms while having fun with makeup we are communicating our styles and emotions but what if someone missed out on the fun that makeup rings in the beginning of my speech i said we are so happy to see you and

00:21:51  
you really are and that's the field we are tackling ellen a famous blind youtuber said makeup is and should be something for all of us to enjoy and we are bringing the entertainment to those who are excluded i would like to focus on people who are actually going to use our mobile app did you know that there are 39 million people who are fully blind but there is also more than 253 million visually impaired people in the world the number of blind people will triple in the next 30 years which creates a massive community

00:22:21  
of people whose daily life will rely on various voice assistants such as ice by looking into this number we saw a huge opportunity for l'oreal to make everyday activities easier and bring more happiness to the life of these people lordal can be the first global makeup brand which will give blind people the opportunity to express themselves through makeup how does iris actually work once you download iris app it is ready to use right away firstly using modified technology iris will scan your face and based on

00:22:49  
collected data it will suggest specific makeup products that match your skin tone and facial features such as foundation shape before applying suggested products you can visit virtual trying room send pictures to your friends and ask them for opinion if you are happy with suggested products you can buy them through irises if you already have the right makeup products just start applying your makeup iris will never get you through the whole process and don't worry if you make any mistakes iris will detect them and inform you

00:23:16  
the app is complemented with iris makeup collection which is a makeup line with unique packaging a specific product design made for effortless usage every iris product will have braille labels and will be included in iris app our products such as foundational lipsticks lipsticks are in october shade for better stability shades and palettes go from lighter to darker colors and mascara brush is shown for maximum precision while applying to make user experience as high quality as possible we will let consumers

00:23:42  
consent collect three types of data personal data such as their age and their location engage in data which will tell us how do consumers interact with the app and behavioral data for example which products are also purchased we would turn this data into knowledge and use it to explore our users preferences and offer them personalized experience within the app lastly iris app will be completely free to download since you want to help as much people as possible on the other hand our main source of

00:24:06  
revenue will be the sales of our collection i'd also like to stress that iris will generate many valuable indirect benefits such as building inclusive brand identity for l'oreal we will also insist on donating a small percentage of revenue to the visually impaired community which will stimulate other people to support iris collection as you can see it says she blooms evil when darkness sings oscar irish step and makeup line can change the whole perspective of makeup and its users just because someone is visually

00:24:30  
impaired doesn't mean that beauty does not exist for them thank you thank you that's our time congratulations for your presentation three minutes that's pretty short but you did great now let's move on to our jury members for the q a session starting now who wants to go first nobody yes sure just one question on the uh have you thought of a feedback loop to other blind people so that they can see or understand the the look that they have been created using sound or music or uh well

00:25:11  
if i understand your question correctly you're asking if we if we're uh tracking the feedback from our customers no it's more to help them get a feedback on the type of look that they they have chosen yes yes so uh once they finish their look they can send the picture to their friends or someone or to their colleagues or to the community the whole community or whatever they pick um and they can give them the feedback if they look um if they apply everything correctly and if and if everything is uh

00:25:43  
means everything is on the right place and also and also uh the in-app feature is a face time so they can um call their friends family and they can double check their makeup and explain them uh what they put how they look and what's the feeling of the makeup thank you very much for this first answer do we have another question yeah i can ask a question sure so i have a question how do you think that this our audiences they will get to know about this service and this app will it be on the website on social

00:26:18  
pages what would you recommend if i understood well you're asking about the marketing scheme yeah okay okay so we had a couple of ideas for the marketing first would be the associations for the blind communities in the world for example in the us where we would send some makeup artists and like have the opportunity to present this kind of app and makeup collection to the blind community and also go through the whole makeup experience in the app the second one would be digital channels and also we would include blind youtubers

00:26:55  
who are uh quite famous for example ellen that's the girl that i was quoting and she would also share those kind of things and of course the normal marketing strategies via instagram facebook and you know like the global corporation marketing but i think and also we would like to uh put pop-up stores or store sections where they can try uh the app like from uh ipad or something and also they can attach the makeup collection and because it's really special that all makeup collection is designed for them

00:27:25  
so they can have the whole experience in the pop-up store or make our section in the store thank you very much uh next question from alexander yes so i have a question about how do you see the app improving the connectivity between blind and non-blind people or impaired people and non-impaired people how do you see that that connective tissue yeah well actually we imagined uh iris as a platform not just uh as a voice assistant but as a platform where the blind people can also um share their experiences not just with

00:27:59  
the other blind people but with the regular people who maybe have uh some visually impaired people in their community or in their surroundings and they just want to understand better the problems and everything the that this community is dealing with so yes definitely we want to improve connectivity between the normal regular people and the uh the community and also if we decided to donate the small percentage of our revenue to visually impaired associations and communities so that's the part where

00:28:33  
we want to uh to push normal people to but normal people people without visual impairment to buy our makeup collection and help visually impair people thank you very much for this answer we're going to go to canada for a question from doug good afternoon and thank you very much for your presentation i'm just wondering if along the road as you developed your app if you actually uh got any sort of user feedback from people with visual impairment and and what what were those learnings along the way

00:29:13  
yeah i contacted the creation blind association and women were especially happy because of that because they know what makeup is and some of them lost their vision during their life and they said that they would be really happy to have someone who would help them and that that that is not a person like by by by them so i think that this kind of app would have would help those people and they said that they would use it especially the younger population very good thank you so much thank you for your answer thank you doug for your

00:29:50  
question thank you jury members that's our time for this first q a session so a big thank you to anna petra and lucia team iris our first presenters of the day we wish you all the best now is the moment to move on to our next team we are about to discover who will go second presenting in front of our jury members now is the moment the second team to present on two days brainstorm 2021 international final is team solas from colombia maria mariana and valentina you had number three you chose the lipstick

00:30:45  
during the semi-final which held number three so you'll go second place on this final now is your time to shine a three minute presentation before our q a session with our jury ladies the floor is yours good luck hey branson we are team salas from colombia i am mariana and with maria jose in valentina we major in design business administration and social psychology that is right we are an interdisciplinary team that today wants to ask all of makeup users how many times have we bought a ton of

00:31:19  
pallets just to create one look because let's be honest finding the perfect eyeshadow palette is a challenge but did you know that women invest more in eye shadows than any other form of makeup so how interesting would it be if for the first time we gave the consumers the power to choose the colors while simplifying their routines that will be great mariana and that is exactly why we created rugee a brush that has a color sensor that will allow you to spread colors from your own reality and reproduce them into

00:31:46  
eyeshadows once you select a color the pigments are toast into a chamber then mix with plates and finally with one click the color falls into the bristles of the brush in regi we saw an opportunity to resignify technology and use it to enrich the relationship between the physical and the digital world to create magical results but ruji is also a community which is why we also create the ruji app in which in addition to using modiface we let customers use other features like entering live streams

00:32:15  
and sharing this experience with friends and creators that is amazing because it is a new shopping experience where you get to shop while learning about our products but let's remember that this year challenge is entertainment and we as a team understand that entertainment is much more than just creating an app it is about bringing people together exactly which is why to increase loyalty and engagement we also develop the radicular tournament the most exciting competition that will let customers win amazing prices

00:32:43  
and create these rare connections so now let's talk about branson's strategy we envisioned this product to have a multi-brand approach because we know that reggie has the power to complement l'oreal brands for our first release we chose to start with urban decay in the u.s because we know urban decay has the power to disrupt the industry and it is the perfect combination of convention and breast makeup and the us is the perfect tech savvy transcending country on our second year we plan to spend in

00:33:09  
saudi arabia and the uk because we found these markets are great opportunities to later extend so now what is our go-to market strategy on our first month we plan to do a special pre-launch for the urban decay beauty junkies because honestly who better to give us feedback than our loyal junkies the brush will be released at a price of 299 dollars and the pigment kit is starting at 42 given that we are using the razer and blades business model which is a model that generates profit primarily on complementary products

00:33:39  
we see a great benefit in using the loose powder formula because it reduces cost now based on our calculations we expect the gross margin of the first year to be 64 percent so i have a question for you l'oreal are you ready to continue being the pioneers of this industry we are team sales from colombia and we are ready to build this dream with you let's bring the world with the colors of \[Music\] rudy three minutes on the dot congratulations ladies great presentation now let's move on to our jury members

00:34:14  
for the q and a session who wants to go first who has the questions yes barbara uh fantastic presentation thank you very much very nice project super exciting uh how did you come to this price positioning of the brush as 299 as it seems to be a little bit high and uh how did you position uh the retail price yes so we actually started by looking at the competition and looking at similar technologies we looked first at perso because l'oreal has been developing something similar in terms of lipstick

00:34:51  
and we saw that person is going out at a price of 299 also we saw um the scribble pen which is a product that is not actually in the market but it has a similar technology and it it was planned to go to the market um at two um three hundred dollars so given this we know that the technology that we're using is um it's a great inversion so um it would have that is why we developed this price because we looked at other technologies that are similar to what we are proposing and we um got to the market with that

00:35:27  
price because we looked at the competition thank you okay great thank you yes thank you very much team it was a lovely presentation and i love to see you've got all the peace in there question tell me more about the tournament and how you would uh invigorate the community okay so we divided the tournament in monthly and annual challenges so the monthly challenges are teamed so for example we are now in june which is the pride month so for example our challenge for the june month will be with the

00:36:00  
pride themed and the creators would have to develop a look with the special shades of reggie and then the the winners of each month will compete at the end of the year in the annual tournament and this time they will have not to create a look but to develop the shade for a l'oreal brand so for example we are starting with urban decay and we would have to ask the consumers which shade is urban decay for you this way we get to get into the consumer's mind and to get a little bit know about what they identified the brands

00:36:31  
with and also they will create the the the shade that they're expecting um and they will be voted until the right shade is chosen and we expect this chain to become a limited edition pigment for the rooty brush so it is a cycle that um brings back to the rooty as well and keeps the public engaged and participating in different ways and also while explaining them how to use the brush and what is the wide range that the brush would have thank you very much for your answer thank you blanca for your question

00:37:09  
do we have a next question for team solas yes yes julio and then congratulations for your presentation and your innovation is very interesting my question uh is about consumer consumer feedback tribe what kind of consumers are you looking for what are what are its specificities uh and you said that consumers in america normally buy 13 kind of shades uh in this case you have one product with thanks to which you can do as many as you want but why do you think they buy 13 is it for having a lot of choice or

00:37:43  
is it for mixing and matching them at the same time with the same look and can your tool do that so regarding the last question i think that um it is regarding the mixing um part of the experience i say this as a makeup consumer as well i have a lot of palettes and i'm using constantly different palettes and i have to travel with very different palettes and it is very heavy and i have to combine the shade and like find this other shade and combine this other palette so this is why we're

00:38:13  
simplifying routines into one into just one product and now regarding the consumers could you repeat the questions i i consumers you're looking for you want to launch under urban decay what do you think is the kind of consumers you're looking for okay so we're looking for consumers we um chose urban decay as the market because um urban decay has always focused on being different on choosing different shapes we know that the range between um that we want to focus in is between 20 to 38 years and we want the public to be

00:38:51  
a very tech savvy um public and a very different disruptive public and that is exactly why we chose urban decay because urban decay actually launched when it launched many years ago that he wanted to disrupt the pink um counters that were always in makeup and we're doing that as well right now so we think that the consumers that normally um buy urban decay will be able well and that's all the time we have thank you very much team solas maria mariana and valentina for your answers and thank you to our

00:39:31  
jury members for your questions now before moving on to our third team let's hear for very warm \[Music\] thank you very much very mum thank you so much so now is the moment to find out which team will be next presenting in this final the next team to perform in this brainstorm 2021 international final for a chance to claim the brainstorm champion title is \[Music\] joining us live from india you had number five you chose the foundation during the semi-final so this is your moment team eye of the storm

00:40:45  
all the way from india a three-minute pitch to convince our jury members you have the best innovation the floor is yours good luck good evening judges team eye of this term from india is here to help consumers use their makeup to the fullest meet sana our young makeup enthusiast she discovers exciting makeup products on instagram all the time she buys them promising herself i am going to style all kinds of fun looks with these but what really happens well hunting for the right influencer and the right look

00:41:21  
trying to follow it and matching it with the product she owns exhausts her so much that she just ends up dumping the product this cycle has turned sana's makeup box into a graveyard of products that she doesn't know how to use she only wishes she had her friends with her to just make makeup fun for all the sanas of the world we present modal a first of its kind artificial intelligence that uses makeup you already own plus other loreal products to create customized looks while allowing you to shop with your

00:41:54  
friends by your side built on the technological expertise of moriface modon will first be fed with a collection of looks created as test sets the ai will use these to analyze shades create desirable combinations and map them to different skin types the results generated will be used to pick products and curate looks using modiface's ar technology to get started all sana does is set up her digital makeup box by scanning all her beauty products in one go to style them she can have more on creative looks for her

00:42:26  
or steal looks sported in her favorite shows will tell her exactly which products from her makeup box and additional l'oreal products she will need to buy to recreate these looks now she has to show the look to her friends so she opens a green room where her girls join her in real time but her friend ria wants to try something different on her so sana happily surrenders to her friend who experiments on her with older eye shadows and lighter lips to create her masterpiece sana loves this new look and instantly

00:42:58  
buys the maybelline lipstick she needs to recreate it this entertaining digital shopping journey will give a huge boost to l'oreal's e-commerce arm by increasing conversions by as much as 40 percent by helping consumers use their products in a fun way modon will make responsible consumption desirable and further the sustainability mission that lies at the heart of l'oreal mordon sets the foundation for collection of rich first party data to be shared across makeup brands product specific competitor data along

00:43:28  
with information on the user's end-to-end journey will help l'oreal identify growth opportunities judges we can feel the dreams brewing sana is dreaming of styling the boldest of looks loreal is dreaming of a data-driven future and us well we are dreaming of turning these dreams into reality with mordon it's time to make makeup happen thank you and thank you very much team eye of the storm great presentation let's turn to our jury members for the q and a session yeah alexander want to go first yeah

00:44:04  
i've questioned so great presentation where did you get or could you um explain a bit more the 80 percent increase engagement 40 e-commerce conversion i mean how did you come up with those uh those numbers right so statista shows that using 3d technologies in an online shopping experience can increase your conversion rates by up to 40 and using ar can give customers the confidence to actually buy and increase the post purchase satisfaction um we have also pegged our numbers to sephora's launch with modification 2018

00:44:36  
and we had similar numbers observed with 2 million active users and 40 million actually try on modifications eight weeks of launch so we can expect similar returns with boot mode on and with engagement we have a social features that can engage people inside a green room where people can join in have more conversation about the makeup products the beauty products that they actually own thank you very much for this first answer and now let's turn to stefan for the next question congratulations for your presentation i

00:45:02  
have one question on the concept of uh reusing the product that you have in your drawer what is the type of technology you will use to be able to identify these products right so according to our artificial intelligence a person can upload these products on their vanity so these would be products that they would have either been using regularly or not been using regularly in terms of it would be left in their closet for the longest time so once the once the user is able to use the technology and the

00:45:32  
product in an efficient way they'll be able to consume the product completely and these products would then be identified in terms of the artificial intelligence figuring out you know one particular product is getting expired and at the same time the person will get a notification or a look recommendation on the basis of that thank you yeah ask me that for the next question yeah hi everybody i i think it's a very entertaining experience to shop together it has always been then the question is

00:45:59  
where do you propose to sell it like do they go and buy this maybelline lipstick that you said on amazon and if they do then uh is there a partnership between the modern and the retailer like how does that work with the many friends being there uh can you tell us more about it right uh so we when we when we thought about mode on we wanted to make uh the first direct to consumer model so then we can set it up over there the other option of course is that we route it through our third-party apps like amazon so when you put you can

00:46:38  
put it in your part you can choose it and select on modon but when you make the payment if we do not have the direct to consumer model there yet we can begin with those apps but for the for the long run we wanted a direct to consumer model and we wanted to make sure that the journey ends begins and ends okay thank you thank you very much for your answer thank you asmita for the question who wants to go next do we have a next question on set everything clear so be an additional question congratulations

00:47:09  
it's very interesting we're living in a world in which consumers want to upskill themselves more and more they want to learn more and more uh there are many examples of this wheel we take masterclass for instance many services are sold online so you you propose to use new products with existing products uh that they have already so is your business model built only on selling products or also selling services like the application right uh so when we actually developed the idea we had a step-by-step guidance and the

00:47:42  
concept of master classes and the concepts of community inside the app uh you know we had to pick our stars for the three-minute presentation so we did that but yes we are planning to sell services there will be master classes which will not just be held by loyal experts but we'll also give the opportunity to influencers to come together and build a community and and educate people in way that they like and in way that people want to be educated uh so yes we do have the existing services that l'oreal

00:48:10  
offers built into this just to make it a whole platform thank you very much yeah barbara for a final question to echo uh the question is modern free to download or do you need to subscribe and to make a payment to get the application button it will be a free to download app uh since we are just it's similar to a platform wherein a customer can just log in register themselves and put their details and about the products and that is to a very seamless process so it will be a free app where a person

00:48:44  
can join and recommend it to their friends as well thank you very much for your answers thank you very much to our jury members for your questions let's give around our applause to team eye of the storm chavi karam and tarano all the way from india we're halfway through this final three teams down three more to go we will keep touring the world with the next one let's discover which teams is next to present to our jury now the team that will go number four in this presentation and get a shot

00:49:20  
at an entrepreneurial experience at l'oreal's headquarters claiming the brainstorm international champion title is team found me from thailand morocco and patra you had number seven because you chose the heart during the semi-final so that's your symbol that's your moment so ladies now is time to shine and deliver your best presentation to our jury members this is your moment a three minute pitch to convince you deserve the title now is the time best of luck to you imagine this you're shopping for new red

00:50:11  
lipstick online but just can't press the purchase button why because one you couldn't imagine how that red lipstick would look on you since the models wearing them look nothing like you that's frustrating the skin tone and lip shape are different from yours and two as a consumer you value reviews in making purchases but it's a hassle to browse through so many platforms from youtube to google before finding the right one good afternoon honorable juries we team thailand are honored to pitch to you

00:50:47  
our idea found me an app that will match you to someone just like you your beauty matches who shares the same skin tone facial features and skin and hair conditions as you find relatable reviews on cosmetics skin care and hair products the idea is that if a product works well on someone similar to you it worked well on youtube and now let's hop on this journey to discover your perfect red lipstick powered by and modification will scan and analyze your face connecting you to your beauty matches with similar

00:51:25  
features like full lips black hair and dry skin and voila your personalized mood board with poses from your beauty matches will appear enjoy filtering for endless entrepreneurs such as colorful makeup or to deuteroneer for skin care but in this case filter for red lipstick click on poses to read product reviews from both l'oreal and outside brands then purchase it in app only if it's from loyal lastly share your own red lipstick review to inspire others make this a point and receive discounts

00:52:05  
with this functionality and entertainment like weekly challenges we vision family to be a must-have app on your phone where you find relatable reviews and make purchases but what's loyal in it for first sales will increase with about 40 ri because we found me customers are confident to purchase knowing that the product will suit them second valuable big data from user activity lawyer can better cater product offering and petite return keeping loyal ahead of the game lastly these benefits are not just for nyx or

00:52:39  
kills but it's for over 25 royal brands now imagine this all over again you need a new red lipstick but this time you've got found me and you found your perfect red lipstick say bye to unrelatable reviews and hi to the perfect reviews from someone just like you so give family a chance and let's create the beauty that moves the world thank you wow congratulations ladies team thailand team found me for your presentation now let's turn to our jury members and who wants to go first for a question

00:53:19  
to team found me okay i can start alex thank you congratulations for the presentation and i have a question about so your vision is uh you capture your uh your audience biometrics and you can offer them filtering on social media to be more relevant but what would be in your mind the best business model as you turn that into value for the customers for l'oreal that parts i need to understand better the the business economics behind found me yes so i would like to get another question from me is just a service app so it

00:54:01  
means that it's roll inside the purchase button the online orders in this app will be redirected to retailers family see fits for the particular order however users also have the option to make physical purchases as they can visit the nearest store location recommended to them what family contributes to l'oreal in the is the incremental sales we can get by providing relatable reviews that makes customers confident to make purchase on products they know will suit them great thank you very much and thank you

00:54:34  
alexander for the question who wants to go next asmita yeah yeah i can ask a question congratulations i think there's an idea there which we could explore now i have two questions in my mind the first one is that you know this idea of app and creating an app and putting it somewhere it's very hard to make apps successful when you launch it on an app store etc so the first thing is where else could it live where is the life so that we can expand you know in terms of the longevity of the whole idea and the

00:55:07  
second question is when you were answering in terms of moving to a retailer's site etc have you thought about the idea of data privacy and you know because we would be looking at people like us so have you i mean what is the thinking on that definitely i would like to take that question so in this case we're choosing to create an app base because we believe that it's the most convenient for users since they can just download it once and always come back to use it for its functionality

00:55:35  
we also want to make this a direct communication platform between loyal and our consumers where we solve their direct pain points so by having it in an app format that is our own we have access to all the data so we can offer them better experiences to cater better personalization and offer better caterings but other opportunities are also feasible such as web-based where we believe that we could definitely extend into that so more people can use this functionality and as for the second question

00:56:08  
um would you mind repeating the second question again yeah my question was because it has found me and you're looking for people like you and it could be within the app where there is a lot of consent how would you uh how would you address the question of data privacy definitely so all of the collected user activity will be on a consensus base this means that we will ask users to consent to having all of their data being collected and used by lawyer however we will explicitly state in the terms and conditions that all the

00:56:40  
data collected will be only used to enhance customers experience on this app to offer superior personalization and cater better offerings great thank you very much our next question comes all the way from canada and goes right to you to thailand doug what's the question you wanted to ask to team found me thank you very much and thank you very much ladies i enjoyed your presentation my question i guess sort of um uh connects to the last question in terms of intellectual property can you tell me

00:57:12  
where you intend to be drawing the images from and the reviews from so if i search for someone that looks like me where are those images coming from all right thank you for your question so um initially we will use um our existing lease resources by collecting poses from loyal models and loyal influences to um kickstart our app and then when the app is launched to the public we'll then encourage normal users on our app to post on our platform as well by giving them incentives such as points

00:57:46  
that can be exchanged for discounts and free samples and with this we aim to create a beauty community where there are reviews from not just influences and model but also organic reviewer from a normal user on our app as well and so on the mood board you see thank you you'll see both models and normal user poses on our platform thank you very much thank you for this final answer that's all the time we have for these q and a sessions so congratulations team found me nutida morocco and patra

00:58:17  
from thailand we wish you all the best and now just before we coming welcoming our next team let's hear some more from barry wong \[Music\] yeah let's keep moving around the world we've got two numbers left on the table two final teams to perform during this final let's see who goes next it's time to reveal the number of the team that will perform next and so we'll have the name of the team performing in last position next team up to present for our jury and get the chance to win the trophy

00:59:14  
this year is \[Music\] team club representing the nordics annalina clara and parisa welcome to the show you had number eight you picked the stars during the semi-final so this is your moment i'm sure you're super excited probably a bit nervous too so this is your three three-minute pitch to our jury your chance to claim the title of brainstorm champion best of luck thank you so welcome we are anna lena paressa and clara from the nordics and today we'll present klubben the kobe 19 pandemic accelerated the

01:00:06  
digital transformation of the beauty sector in which l'oreal saw a 62 growth this shift in consumer behavior is predicted to be permanent but now that we should be focusing on the online customer journey we're missing the aspect that actually made something entertaining the experience with friends we used to go to the shopping malls try on products give recommendations to each other and have fun with our friends but now we're in our bed screwing the products on our laptop and most of the time we're completely alone

01:00:33  
which is neither exciting nor entertaining isn't it weird that people used to go shopping together but e-commerce is all about shopping alone here we present to you kluben empowering real social shopping let's see the han and maria enter the kruben platform together and have a shared view of the store environment being in a video called live while shopping the two friends recommend makeup and hair color products to each other when they're done browsing they enter the beauty room to try on the

01:01:02  
selected products and give each other advice on how they look the online shopping experience becomes a fun time with friends so how does kluben work the platform will be an integrated web app on retailer sites to create the experience of a store within a store hannah can simply create a code and share it with maria through social media plus the platform offers four attractive features an editorial trendy landing page personalized l'oreal product recommendations a chatbot for expert assistance and

01:01:30  
group discounts so what's the game plan the platform will be trendy and promote interaction making gen z customers the perfect target group they are tech savvy and with a purchasing power in progress the product range available on the platform will be a curated selection of l'oreal brands klubun is also cost efficient since it leverages existing technologies like modiface finally we know that data is gold and cuban multiplies our database which can be used for potential expansion into skin care

01:01:59  
so what makes club and the future of beauty and a game changer for l'oreal firstly kluben will be the first to reinvent the beauty experience before retailers by making online shopping a fun activity with friends leading to word of mouth and network effects secondly cuban integrates the power of friends recommendations which is the number one purchase driver in beauty and more powerful than influencers social media ads or any other source for shopping recommendations thirdly modified technology was found to

01:02:31  
double conversion rates by increasing the average consumer visit time on websites clinton will further increase the visit times by adding the social aspect resulting in even higher conversion rates in conclusion we are analiana pareza and clara and we are the right team to bring the solution to l'oreal today we presented club the platform that brings back the fun experience \[Music\] congratulations great presentation and now let's turn to our jury baba you have a question thank you very much

01:03:08  
for the presentation very interesting uh idm essay i have a question because here you are reinventing your friend experience while shopping is it possible also because you're alone at home you all your friends are sleeping can you enter this online shop and then to bump into someone else that is also alone and that can be with you to help you in your shopping experience did you thought about this thank you so much for your question so the idea is initially that you we will start developing developing the

01:03:45  
platform by uh creating a code that you can share together with your friends if we see um a potential need to meet other people in this platform this is a feature that we will of course uh add in relation to our launch we will gain the relevant insights to see what needs there are for potential expansion uh so that is something we will definitely consider thank you thank you very much who wants to go next i can ask if there is meter yeah no it's it's a very interesting idea and it's true that in today's virtual world

01:04:19  
whether you're on twitch watching esports or apple tv watching tv together people want to get together i have a i have a question which i don't know if why have the platforms or the e-commerce players not doing it already do you do you think any challenge in doing that have you thought about it yes maybe i can take that question um we we think this is uh we're actually surprised that nobody has done this before but we also think that it's also connected to the technology and l'oreal has already the technology with

01:04:54  
modiface you have the option to also try on the products which is uh the most important one of the most important features of cluben uh so you get to have the experience with friends and also with the live interaction and try to own the products so the modification technology is essential um in a central future so maybe that is also why nobody has done this before okay thank you thank you very much for your answer yeah no i actually i was on the same page so great presentation first and congratulations for for being on final

01:05:29  
um i was trying to assess during the presentation what's the experience in the concept of collaborative shopping together online is brilliant so it's clearly a huge need the question is that you create really an addictive experience where it makes sense and modiface is indeed somewhere where you're going to have an exchange you can have people spending hours playing around with products and then you can connect back to a purchase or browsing and you see the business model in your mind today of

01:06:01  
of creating this collaborative shopping digital shopping experience how do you see this turning into into an economic model yes thank you for your question um so we were thinking to have kluben offered on as a service on the retailer sites and to create the experience of a store within a store and the platform will provide a curated selection of l'oreal group brands but the platform will be offered for free both for the end consumers and for the retailer but if the retailer wants to add other

01:06:35  
brands outside the loyal group we will request a fee all right thank you let's turn to doug in canada for the next question interesting answer thank you very much for your presentation i guess my question is if if two people can come together to shop together have you thought about the possibility of more people uh coming together as a group and potentially even hosting parties where people can get together and shop and i guess the second part of my question is if that's possible is it also possible

01:07:10  
then that the influencer in that group could potentially earn an affiliate commission on sales that occur through the party so thank you so much for your question regarding the first part of the question with more than two of course and our visuals only represent the two people participating in the video call but of course you can send this invite to a couple of friends and you can have more of a group of shopping experience which can further enhance the experience and for the second part of your question

01:07:44  
that sounds uh really great we have already thought of using influencers as a marketing as a prime marketing activity uh primarily for the launch but also um continuing the work so for instance influencer friends can uh live stream their experience on social media showing what a fun experience it is shopping together so incorporating the role of influencers can be thankful thank you thank you very much for your answers thank you jury members for your questions let's give a round of applause

01:08:16  
to annalina tara and theresa tim cloven congratulations uh so if you followed closely this celebration in this final there should be no surprise which team will go next we have one team left and the final team to perform for us today and for our jury members you guessed it let's find out where they come from \[Music\] team spot beauty with leah ellis and elise who picked the lightning bolt during the semi-final hello ladies so you'll be going last we wish you all the best for the three minute pitch your chance

01:09:11  
to convince the jury your innovation is the best for l'oreal best of luck hello everyone i'm elise i'm also elise and i'm nothing is buttlia and today we are going to present you our innovation which is luckily as unique as the personality spot beauty but first let's start with an overview of the later trends nowadays we hear increasingly about apps or websites that allow us to find clothes worn by our favorite celebrity or by anyone else but what about the makeup in all of this

01:09:44  
indeed consumers are in search of the different makeup products in all social networks or on the preferred tv show for example euphoria on kdramas and what can we do for this consumer in the week that they would like to find the product they love the response is simple spot beauty this is the shazam of makeup which will in the first instance focus on four colorful brands from l'oreal nyx urban decay schwemura and tracy to have a worldwide impact but what is this really about let's find out

01:10:14  
imagine chelsea is looking forward to the release of the new season of her favorite tv show and she sees this image zendaya with the perfectly shade and the eyeshadow she needs but she can't find this product well now she can by downloading the spot beauty apps you can find all the similar products that allow her to reproduce the makeup she just has to add them to a shopping cart or try them out usually first and do her best makeup but how does it work when you spot a makeup on the internet

01:10:44  
nothing has your with the spot booty app all you have to do is take a screenshot upload it to the app and thanks to the makeup recognition algorithm the magic happened a drop down list with similar product appears of course now you want it just click on the product and you will be able to make your purchase directly on the app simple spot it screenshot it and get it it will also be possible to create an account for a more personalized experience you will be able to list previously purchase makeup are articles to the

01:11:12  
saved item section and also select filters to target the brand of your choice or even more check out your suggestions for products to complete the look how will we make this innovation go viral online we will mainly focus on tick tock where we will launch a challenge if you want to take part film yourself using the app by mentioning i want it and then make the desired product appear in your hand by replicating it it will go viral then offline we will offer the possibility to use the app in stores offering a digital

01:11:45  
experience and what about the future the scalability of the app to all the l'oreal make a brand explained now that you have discovered our innovation let's take a closer look at the main benefits that it can bring to l'oreal the brand awareness an increase in conversion and obviously data collection now we have just one more thing to tell you you want it get it and that's it congratulations to team spot beauty from belgium great presentation as well now let's turn to our jury members for

01:12:20  
the questions who wants to go first yes i have a question thank you very much for the presentation um here i'm in the recognition the sazam kind of uh technology will allow you to recognize a color and maybe a matte or a shiny effect but there are other attributes for the product such as a long-lasting etcetera how will you help consumers to target precisely the right product to purchase yes we will propose the products that are similar and they can we will propose different products and they can choose the one

01:13:06  
that match the most with them their own uh preferences so to to to echo you or to continue my question does it mean that in the list of proposed products you will have attributes to it to characterize the colorism should be similar but how do you help the consumer then to choose between the list that product when they click on the product they will be able to see the description and then they can see uh if it's a a long last product 24 hours or the other attribute of the product and they will be able to choose the one that

01:13:46  
matched the most with their their preferences okay thank you thank you very much barbara for your question thank you for your answer let's turn to stephan for the next question congratulations for your great presentation i have a question on the business model do you see that app being uh given for free do you see to develop some services that will that would you have to pay for so what what is the business model behind your proposal at the beginning it would be free and actually i think it would be always free

01:14:16  
but l'oreal would gain consumers because it would increase conversion because the purchase process would be directly included in the app thank you very much turning on to the next question who wants to go next no other questions no questions here on set everything is clear clear for me so i think we're good your presentation was crystal clear ladies so great job you did it you're done congratulations let's give them a round of applause and ellie's team spot beauty from belgium

01:28:13  
this experience i've been able to keep in touch with a lot of them since uh then and that is what i prefer during the whole experience on the other hand the experience is really stressful but also very motivating at the same time so especially during the studies the fact of participating in the brainstorm is a real challenge so my feedback is finally really positive because even today i can see the advantage of having participated great thank you our jury's coming back i have one a final question for you we'd like to know

01:28:46  
what's happened since for you where are you standing right now in your project uh so we are very happy because we i came back from paris we had the opportunity to continue the l'oreal experience in switzerland and it's very different uh from what we did in paris because we are now still working in our project um that we had in the brainstorm but it's also very interesting and exciting and exciting and you know for me uh i was able to start directly at laurel citizen as a melody so directly after the

01:29:23  
entrepreneurship in paris so it's a very interesting interesting job that i love currently i am in the sales team in e-commerce for the consumer product division so exactly the same as melody so actually we are even working together and to be honest we really loved it another thing that i wanted to share you know is at the beginning many people told me about the energy of the people working at l'oreal and to be honest i didn't really believe it so now i find it very rewarding and i feel

01:29:53
