00:11:40  
\[Applause\] hello living learners can you hear me yes yeah very exciting wow you look great welcoming our spaceship i guess you must be nervous you're doing the worst being the first team to open this big final well actually it is an honor how do you feel right now nervous but really excited to go we're really you know great we are happy to be a privilege to be here and yeah we can't wait to get started okay here we go three two one go so we present lumilido a one of a kind stamp eyeliner with features specially

00:12:25  
crafted for the visually impaired community apart from providing braille on our packaging we are aware that less than 10 percent of the visually impaired community comprehends it hence meet lumi lumi is molly's best friend an interactive ai assistant on lumi liner that will guide you on each step of your eyeliner application in the language that you understand now how will domi liner exactly work it's a very good presentation yeah like the the slides are very your wing selection it's super

00:12:53  
professional collecting wings from complex names such as the arrangement but in a lot of effort and it looks very uh on brand also the design the colors molly then simply press the button and make her selection but today molly is in a groovy mood since she's going to a party she doesn't want to go with her usual black liner so lumi will not only give you any colored liner in this world but also using its ai it will give you the recommendations for your perfect eyeliner look after that it will guide you for the

00:13:24  
correct placement of your eyeliner stamp making sure that it's right over your eye and voila there you are now you can simply stamp your liner and get those quick symmetric and smudge free wings in your favorite color but hey now molly wants to know how she looks she can also scan her liner using the camera and lumi will let her know if she's done a good job or she needs to redo it an eyeliner makes me feel so bold and confident we want our users to feel just that but without it having to feel like a

00:13:54  
lifelong struggle wow thank you very much leave me liners was really really enjoyable to see but i am sure that our jury has a few questions for you please do give i really love the presentation one question i have for you is on the camera itself can you tell us a little bit more how it works because how will it scan exactly what how exactly does the camera itself work um lumi works on ai as well as on machine learning so we have a camera at the end of our liner so you can scan your eyeliner keeping the camera face towards you and

00:14:35  
because it uses machine learnings we will be feeding into it pictures of how a correct liner looks versus how a disrupted or a wrongly placed liner looks that way lumi using its voice will give you a feedback and tell you if it's done correctly or you need to redo it all right thank you very much so congratulations to you lumi liners let's now welcome our second team coming from austria and germany the inclusioners \[Applause\] hello feel common hi how are you doing we're great yeah that's so impressive yeah

00:15:21  
so nice to see them all together i wish we were yeah we were together but we were in the separate rooms but it's so nice to see them standing there okay so i saw the team was like from germany and austria so where are you currently right now we're in dusseldorf right now in germany so let's go is this houston do you copy do you hear us are you on the moon yet uh yes \[Music\] but i'm afraid we're not the first here what who's there before us is it elon musk no it's l'oreal

00:16:14  
\[Music\] hi brainstormers we are the inclusionists mailing fernando and milena today we present you our idea for a more inclusive world have you ever thought about how people with limitations use personal care products we talk to people with different forms of disabilities they told us that the products are only five finger user friendly which makes the use of a product very difficult also the products are very slippery and that's not easy to group we want to redesign personal care products like shower gels and shampoos because

00:16:53  
these are a daily necessity for all of us let's start with the most important pillar based on the interviews we had we came to our prototype our redesign has notches and round edges so it's easier to apply and to grab a magnet integrated in the cap eases the opening process as well for every one of us because plastic bottles are often too slippery we add recycled paper instead this ensures a good grip and is much more sustainable here we can use the existing knowledge of garnier and sante

00:17:29  
for visually impaired people we add bright labels integrated with a qr code anyway it's a very interesting vision of inclusivity and i guess the jury has a lots of questions for you three who wants to start the question time first of all bravo a very creative and and very interesting uh uh idea uh so congratulations to you i have a question because uh at first time i've been exposed to this idea of the only five fingers user friendly i think it's a very nice perspective very interesting one

00:18:08  
i have a question about the price is it a refillable bowl or is it a one use bottle that you have designed here i didn't get this point please we already thought about the option of a refillable packaging for this redesign and unfortunately we are not able to develop this idea further as do the time limitations until now but we are considering this and we want to further develop this idea okay thank you very much for your answer good luck to you but now let's welcome our final team for the inclusion track the team all beauty

00:18:51  
from mexico \[Applause\] \[Music\] yeah i love to see like the group dynamics yeah yeah together go imagine waking up one day and everything you know how to do changes now you have to learn how to adapt to the world because there is nothing in it that adapts to you the original makeup is meant for everyone and at the moment that a person cannot express it freely and autonomously it means that traffic was wrong it means it's time to make a change and that's why we're here in turtles in stable the first adaptive eye makeup

00:19:34  
tool intern power inclusive beauty stable by maybelline is meant for everyone no matter their physical abilities besides being the number one makeup brand in the world we knew maybelline was the perfect match for us for being a brand devoted to diversity disrupting all beauty standards to embody bold and brilliant energy to sum it up we want to offer you a night makeup product line to accomplish your full look that consists of a mascara an extra brush and a liquid eyeliner that works together with a face

00:20:01  
allowing you to apply it with gut movements by simulating a steady congratulations team or beauty that's very impressive but there i'm sure the jury has more questions for you maybe my question is because i saw a small demo about how it works i need to understand better so well stable it's um mainly composed of a vase and the applicators and the caps where the product is contained so the main objective is that people with different conditions can use it in different ways so they can take out of

00:20:49  
the cap maybe with the gap located at the bottom with their hands if they're not able to use their hands correctly or with their hands but with a steady hand that the magnetic caps will allow to take it easily then the objective is to put it in the base and then you can adjust the angle of the applicator so you can create the movement with your head so you can make the perfect look all right thank you very much that's all for our beauty team \[Applause\] the next three teams will compete for

00:21:23  
the green track with three disruptive sustainable projects to reduce our ecological footprint so let's welcome the first team team rocket paper sisters from the philippines \[Applause\] hello philippines how are you doing oh you look great well i guess you've been working a lot on this presentation yes we have we have okay let's go three two one go consumers today are more aware than ever of the need for daily sun protection yet 46 of americans still fail to wear sunscreen regularly and on

00:22:07  
the go alex tells us why look i want to get into the habit of wearing sunscreen to protect my skin but i have people to meet and deadlines to beat i can't afford to put my day on hold to apply it pocket locket dissolving sunscreen wipes a broad spectrum sunscreen wipe that dissolves completely into a gel as it is applied each wipe holds the correct 2.5 ml dosage for a full face and neck coverage and they're encased in compact pods that fit in your pocket so you can protect your skin anywhere this is

00:22:35  
something everyone needs so it's a very the efficacy of the sun gel and you don't see that many things because we did our research as well melts into your skin gradually as it is swiped on the face and dissolves to a gel fully as it is rubbed between your hands to be spread on the neck it's as simple as wipe rub and spread whether you're commuting playing sports outdoors or traveling for work okay okay thank you very much but first a few minutes with audrey who wants to stop and question these guys

00:23:10  
from the philippines uh thank you very much but i love the name i love the concept but as i'm in charge of sustainability i do not understand how you make that a serial waste and a sustainable product because you know that this kind of of small plastic devices are very not very often recyclable i don't understand how the refill could work and also because you talked a lot about zero waste so how do you imagine that's your waste model and how have you built it please so our wipe just to clarify how it works

00:23:46  
the wipe dissolves completely into a gel so instead of a regular polyester wipe you get a zero waste application because the product melts into your skin and the pod itself is made from post-consumer recycled plastic so instead of you getting four bottles of sunscreen a year which adds to plastic waste you can get a pod and a refill three refills and after you get the refill you get to sustain sunscreen use and create the sustainable habit okay thank you very much you did a great job let's now welcome

00:24:25  
the second team the hell raisers from india \[Applause\] hello gmail razers hi are you ready yes we are ready okay so let's go three two one go presenting to you the semi-solid pellet moisturizer by l'oreal paris a unique formulation majorly made of essential oils to provide the perfect moisturizing effect to your skin and it also addresses the given gaps now let me show you a very quick demo on how to apply this palette moisturizer just pick up a palette rub it between your palms and apply it on your face it is as easy as

00:25:09  
that our l'oreal paris palette moisturizer is environment friendly too it just contains 30 percent of the water in the form of hydrosol which is obtained sustainably and we don't just stop the the product level the outer packaging is made of completely recyclable cardboard which anna can use in our gardens to make some compost the inner box is the design is very clean yeah it feels like available in abundance and can easily dissolve into the water ecosystem innovation and sustainability are all

00:25:40  
wrapped into one join us on a mission to save millions of liters of water all right thank you very much here you are thank you hell raises now i leave you between the hands of our jury who wants to start have you thought where will you distribute it in the same channels where the currently the cream is and you know on the same shelf so how would you kind of create a kind differentiation for the consumers who are already buying the products so uh basically what we are doing like we have on our website we

00:26:15  
have the system called appellate coins like the lowell uh royalty program for the customers who are already buying the products so what we will do once the customer buys the day cream like for example all the loyal customers who are buying currently moisturizers from us we'll be targeting to them so after they buy the day cream we will be giving some coins in form of discounts to them so after uh they get the points they can use the same discount coupon to the other product like night cream and

00:26:38  
tinted moisturizer so that's why that's how we will cross-sell them upsell them the products but coming to a shelf life point we will be keeping the products uh like the cannerization will happen like the current user of moisturizer florida in the liquid form they will be moving to the solid pallet moisturizer so can application will happen but the customer will remain in the lower longer okay i hope i wanted to go yeah very very clear thank you now let's welcome our final team for the

00:27:08  
green track ladies and gentlemen team bamboo from argentina \[Applause\] hello buenos aires how are you doing hi thank you well we're very happy to welcome you here in paris are you ready to pitch your project yes of course 100 so 3 2 1 go hi l'oreal we're team bamboo and we're here to revolutionize sunscreen habits with our eco-conscious packaging our new product is a bamboo container with interchangeable and recyclable cardboard cartridges that contain antelope's face sunscreen formula

00:27:49  
featuring various aluminum applicators to choose from sunny is an european college girl that is looking for her ideal sunscreen while streaming from the pharmacy aisles our products organic appearance and pocket size format draw her attention she is environmentally conscious about our product as its curve for the planet while protecting her skin then she uses the applicator and formula that align best to her skin type after two months of daily use sunny sunscreen runs out her bamboo container can be reused 10

00:28:17  
times so she buys a new cartridge and replaces in three simple steps bamboo is the heart of innovation which is high versatility it has great potential for cover circulation and plays a unique role in mitigating climate change we also buy this nova material from india and china our resources will be traceable and we worry fsc certified plantation to ensure that material are responsible sourced thank you very much that was great the great work great job i know there's plenty to say about this

00:28:47  
project and this is what you're going to talk about with the jury so he wants to ask the first question the design is super slick so i love congratulations i think it's really eye-catching uh packaging i have a question uh because the la roche posay i'm a big customer and i always check the expiration date because as you know this product has an expiration date and you need to change it every year had you looked at that because it felt that the packet the packaging being inside uh one of the most important

00:29:20  
feature is the expiration date so is it something you thought about or the cartridge will last up to uh when until it's empty then it will be recharged with a new cartridge that you will buy in the pharmacy and keep the container so um for the the bamboo itself it's a it has a very long shelf life but we due to um hygiene matters we want to preserve the formulation that the roche is very strict with so we will keep it to at least 10 uses of different cartridges and i think that that answers

00:29:53  
your question all right thank you very much tim bamboo did a great job good luck to you it's now time to open our final track with our three lost competing teams pitching three projects fueled by tech so now let's welcome our first team for the final track the tech track team mausoleu from indonesia \[Applause\] hello indonesia hi hi how are you doing yeah we're doing great and so excited for uh today let's go three two one go i don't like how my skin looks when i have my period and as a woman i don't

00:30:41  
feel confident with it but treating it doesn't promise me that in my next period i will not face the same bee in july is not alone there are 78 of people who have worse skin conditions during their period these problems are caused by the fluctuations of hormone a chemical substance that plays a role in our skin health throughout our life from year period pregnancy to menopause the most fluctuated hormones are estrogen and progesterone and by ignoring hormone factors this could lead to many other

00:31:12  
skin problems that can occur in the future and that's where the idea of pressing a hyper personalized skincare innovation consists of three sub products hyper test your reliable hormone test hyper app your smart integrated app and hyper care you're all in one person wow prototypes so cool let's meet hyper test a rapid robust and reliable hormone test through finger stick blood to analyze hormonal level with only one single medical test with its biosensor sensitivity it will detect the initial level of estrogen and

00:31:46  
progesterone to become the initial base of hormonal prediction now have your hormonal prediction sync through the hyper app your infinite skin care journey the app's learning system will give you access to features in skin analysis that will gather real-time data from menstrual cycles in and skin genius that it could be improved the ai modeling for a better skin analysis and recommendation but do you only get a recommendation or not we have hyper care all in one personalized skincare applicator device

00:32:20  
with the existing personal tag we give you the personalized serum dosage based on your hormonal and external condition you don't need to mix or layer anything because there are three categories with three different types of serum to take care of your skin those interconnection makes hyper thing a promising yet a simple solution thank you very much mussoli that's an excellent job i just have a question i have three categories of serums if it's three whatever woman and then it's a dosage between the three

00:32:54  
of it to compose the right formulation or do you have i don't know 10 12 different categories and then it's adapted to each person it's three cartridges for one device and it contains of three different functions and it depends on the person's skin conditions as well and the dosage will be adjusted every day based on your hormonal condition that day okay thank you very much let's now welcome the second team coming from italy welcome team blue parade \[Applause\] here you are team blue parade i can see

00:33:35  
two of you are you ready to compete of course we are of course okay here you go three two one go our product is null null is the first ai powered patch maker but why did we create null many consumers don't want just the perfect product for themselves but want something tailored for them so we conducted a survey and we found out that many of them prefer having diy treatments at home and professional treatments so our solution is null the first air powered device that will make a microneedle patches that

00:34:13  
that ensure a better penetration in the skin so let's look at the device on the upper part we have the entrance of the ingredients where the user has to put ingredients we also have a mixer that will mix them and on the bottom part we have the apart where we where the user has to insert the microfib the micro needle sets they will make by the a galvanic micro needles the ingredient mixed vinyl and the adjective patch our needles are more effective than traditional products that have to be rubbed from

00:34:47  
to the face because they ensure a better presentation after you work first thing the user has to scan the face with the modifies powered up then see the list of ingredients pour the ingredients in the in the mixer and then wait for the notification that the patches are ready okay thank you very much alex does that exist already as a as a technology that you can yourself make micro needles with something micro needles are already in the market but our micro needles are special because they're all all those

00:35:25  
and cutting the tip because in this way we we aim to give a much a large margin of personalization so our kind of needles are never seen they're not seen they're not in the market okay thank you very much tim blue parade we saw perhaps meet you in paris well now last but not least welcome to a third and last team the rogers innovation squad from the usa \[Applause\] \[Music\] ready steady go like most people i'm extremely dependent on my skincare products i remember one time when my favorite product ran out

00:36:15  
and i couldn't find it in any store my skin broke out intensely and i started to lose all my self-confidence all because i didn't have a refill at my disposal introducing impact beauty a hardware software integrated technology that instantly provides you with a constant supply of your favorite products this innovation consists of three parts a l'oreal skin care product containing are so ambitious i'm super incorporated and the impact beauty app when a product is placed on or taken off

00:36:49  
the impact scale for usage the tag reader within the scale will identify the rfid tagged product and communicate with your impact beauty app by measuring the difference in product weight the app will automatically send you a refill when you have 20 percent of your product left consumers can purchase a subscription to automatically receive a refill when the scale detects that their product is almost empty these refills will be delivered in biodegradable pouches that will reduce 90 of packaging costs and

00:37:15  
packaging waste impact beauty not only offers convenient refills but the app is also a free content platform product hub and retail site it features application instructions personal usage data recommended skincare routines product recommendations loyalty programs and even influencer tutorials the app will also have a virtual assistant named lori that can help the visually impaired identify differentiate and locate their products by scanning the rfid tag thank you very much you did a great job all right alex the idea about this

00:37:46  
refill logistics based on customer demand is is very powerful but i'm wondering how many of the products today have a tag uh is it something that exists in uh so the big challenge the barrier trees the the tag itself in some ways that was so i don't know if you look at that or is there like maybe sweet spot instead of going for one million customer where are your first uh a thousand customers or ten thousand customers is there like a sweet spot product you see in the l'oreal family of

00:38:17  
products that you think would be a good target first so um once when we first thought of this idea um josh actually he went to uniglo and he found the rfid tag within the product so many early adapters such as uniqlo and even nike they're starting to implement it into the products not only to enhance the supply chain but also to enhance a user's experience so many people are currently using that they like to call rfid the future of technology for retail stores um so i think that that's

00:38:46  
something that um gorilla can definitely benefit from so we now have listened to online semi-finalist pitches congratulations to all these nine teams this was an excellent work i think i'm gonna give all of them a last round of applause well my dear members of the jury it's now your turn to sweat a bit a difficult task awaits you to select our three winners so good luck for the \[Applause\] deliberation dear friends dear competitors that's set after deliberation the jury is back so dj remembers now that you do have the
