# MEMOIR Business Model Analysis
## Extracted from Team Discussion Transcript

---

## PART 1: EXTRACTED WISDOM & KEY INSIGHTS

### Competition Context
- **3-slide pitch deck**: Only way to communicate business idea/concept
- **3-minute pitch video**: Focus on team dynamics, character, thinking style
- **Evaluation weighting**: Innovation, sustainability, inclusivity = 15/25 points (heavily weighted)
- **Key requirement**: Simple, digestible presentation that answers questions without clutter
- **Winning formula**: 3-step business process (industry standard for case competitions)

### Core Concept Insights
1. **Nostalgia as emotional anchor** - Focus on past memories rather than future
2. **AI as enabler, not creator** - AI outputs recommendations, humans craft the fragrance
3. **Luxury = Human-made** - People equate luxury with human craftsmanship
4. **Technology must be seamless** - Can't look like tech for tech's sake
5. **Personalization paradox** - Memory accuracy vs. personal scent preferences

### Marketing Wisdom
- People already practice "scent anchoring" for major life events (weddings, etc.)
- MEMOIR name perfectly correlates with memory/nostalgia positioning
- Could capture memories from the past OR things not from our time (Marilyn Monroe example)
- Bottle design opportunity: Include miniature photo of the memory

## PART 2: ALL QUESTIONS RAISED

### User Experience Questions
1. How do users describe scents when most people can't articulate olfactive experiences?
2. How does the app guide users who don't know fragrance terminology?
3. How do we ensure the received fragrance matches what they actually like?
4. What if the AI-generated scent is true to the image but not to the person's preferences?

### Technology Questions
5. How does AI actually translate visual elements to olfactive notes?
6. What's the real utility of technology if in-store staff could ask the same questions?
7. How do we embed technology seamlessly without it looking forced?

### Business Model Questions
8. In-store experience vs. app-only vs. hybrid - which model?
9. Is L'Oreal ready for 30-minute in-person consultations?
10. What's the complete customer journey from start to finish?
11. How do sampling and approval work before final purchase?
12. What's the delivery timeline (2-3 weeks mentioned)?
13. How does L'Oreal source the organic/quality ingredients?
14. What's the role division between AI and Master Perfumer?

### Scalability Questions
15. How does this scale if each fragrance is truly custom?
16. What's the pricing model for custom luxury fragrances?
17. How do you handle returns/dissatisfaction?

## PART 3: LOOPHOLES & CONTRADICTIONS IDENTIFIED

### Loophole 1: The Preference-Memory Conflict
**Problem**: AI creates scent true to the memory image, but customer might not actually LIKE that scent.
**Example**: Beach memory → AI suggests salty, sunscreen notes → Customer hates those scents on their skin
**Current Status**: UNRESOLVED

### Loophole 2: Technology Justification Gap
**Problem**: If it's an in-store experience with a person asking questions and a perfumer mixing, what's the actual need for AI/technology?
**Stated Concern**: "The mission wants us to use a technological element... shouldn't look like implementing something for sake of it"
**Current Status**: UNRESOLVED

### Loophole 3: Process Length vs. Luxury Experience
**Problem**: Profile creation → App interaction → Shipping to store → In-store visit = Too long
**Counter-argument**: If process is too long, people would just go to store directly
**Current Status**: UNRESOLVED

### Loophole 4: Scent Description Barrier
**Problem**: "Even for me, I can't describe the fragrance or the scent of a moment"
**Proposed Solution**: Preset surveys, simple terminology
**Gap**: Surveys still don't solve the chemistry issue (fragrance smells different on everyone)
**Current Status**: PARTIALLY ADDRESSED

### Loophole 5: Quality Assurance Without Sampling
**Problem**: How does customer approve fragrance before final creation?
**Mentioned Ideas**:
- Send 3 samples, customer chooses
- Walk into showroom, try samples, perfumer remixes
**Gap**: Neither clearly defined in the 3-step process
**Current Status**: UNRESOLVED

### Loophole 6: In-Store vs. Digital Conflict
**Problem**: Team oscillating between:
- "Should be an in-store experience" (Alex)
- "L'Oreal not ready for 30-min in-person meetings" (Matthew)
- "Need to figure out entire customer journey" (Udbhav)
**Current Status**: NO CONSENSUS

### Loophole 7: Existing Competition Gap
**Problem**: Custom fragrance services already exist (Vancouver brand mentioned, Guerlain mentioned at $3000)
**Unresolved**: What makes MEMOIR different/better?
**Current Status**: DIFFERENTIATION UNCLEAR

## PART 4: CURRENT 3-STEP MODEL (FROM TRANSCRIPT)

```
Step 1: UPLOAD
- Share your favorite memory
- Beach vacation, wedding day, grandmother's garden
- (Also mentioned: voice notes, text descriptions)

Step 2: AI ANALYSIS
- Proprietary AI analyzes visual elements
- Translates them into olfactive notes
- Creates formula/recommendation

Step 3: CREATION & DELIVERY
- Master Perfumer creates custom blend
- Delivered in 2-3 weeks
- Photo printed on bottle
```

### Missing Elements in Current Model:
1. User profile/preference capture
2. Sampling/approval step
3. Pricing information
4. What happens if customer doesn't like it
5. Clear value proposition vs. existing services
6. Technology integration details
7. Sustainability/inclusivity messaging

## PART 5: JUDGE'S LIKELY QUESTIONS

Based on the analysis, judges will likely ask:

1. **"How do you guarantee customer satisfaction with a custom fragrance they've never smelled?"**
2. **"What happens if the customer doesn't like the final product?"**
3. **"How is this different from existing custom fragrance services?"**
4. **"How does the AI actually work - what's the technology?"**
5. **"Is this scalable? Can you handle thousands of unique formulations?"**
6. **"What's the price point and who's the target customer?"**
7. **"How does this align with L'Oreal's sustainability commitments?"**
8. **"What's the timeline from order to delivery?"**
9. **"Where does this fit in L'Oreal's brand portfolio?"**
10. **"Why would someone choose this over going to an existing perfumer?"**
