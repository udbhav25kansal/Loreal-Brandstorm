## 8. CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (LTV)

### 8.1 LTV Calculation (Average Customer)

**Assumptions:**
- Average customer lifespan: 4 years
- Purchases over lifetime: Initial + 1 refill/year + possible subscription conversion

#### Customer Journey Modeling

**YEAR 1 (Acquisition):**
- Initial Purchase: €220 (MEMOIR Custom)
- Contribution Margin: €164.50

**YEAR 2:**
- 40% order refill: 0.4 × €120 = €48 revenue
- Contribution Margin: 0.4 × €78 = €31.20

**YEAR 3:**
- 30% order another custom: 0.3 × €220 = €66
- 20% subscribe (€180/qtr): 0.2 × €720 = €144
- Total: €210 revenue
- Contribution Margin: €158

**YEAR 4:**
- 20% continue subscription: 0.2 × €720 = €144
- 15% order another custom: 0.15 × €220 = €33
- Total: €177 revenue
- Contribution Margin: €133

**Total LTV Over 4 Years:**
- Total Revenue: €220 + €48 + €210 + €177 = **€655**
- Total Contribution Margin: €164.50 + €31.20 + €158 + €133 = **€486.70**

**Net LTV (after CAC):** €486.70 - €75 (CAC) = **€411.70**

---

### 8.2 LTV Segmentation

Different customer types have different LTV:

| Customer Segment | % of Base | Avg LTV (4-yr) | Contribution to Avg |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **One-Time Buyers** | 40% | €164.50 | €65.80 |
| **Occasional Repeat** (1-2 refills) | 35% | €300 | €105.00 |
| **Loyalists** (3+ purchases) | 15% | €650 | €97.50 |
| **Subscribers** (convert Year 2+) | 10% | €1,200 | €120.00 |
| **Weighted Average LTV** | 100% | - | **€388.30** |

**Conservative Blended LTV:** €390 (rounded)

---

### 8.3 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

#### Year 1 CAC (Expert Phase)

**Total Marketing Spend:** €1,000,000
**New Customers Acquired:** 20,000
**CAC:** €1,000,000 / 20,000 = **€50**

**Channels:**
- Influencer seeding: €200K / 5,000 customers = €40
- PR/Organic: €180K / 8,000 customers = €22.50
- Paid social ads: €200K / 4,000 customers = €50
- Referrals: €100K / 3,000 customers = €33

**Blended CAC:** €50

#### Year 2 CAC (Scaling Phase)

**Total Marketing Spend:** €2,800,000
**New Customers:** 80,000 (100K units - 20K existing customers reordering)
**CAC:** €2,800,000 / 80,000 = **€35**

**Why Lower?** Better channel efficiency, organic word-of-mouth, brand awareness established.

#### Year 3+ CAC

**Year 3:** €5.5M / 150K new = **€37** (slight increase due to saturation)
**Year 4:** €8M / 200K new = **€40** (maintain efficiency at scale)
**Year 5:** €10.5M / 250K new = **€42** (mature market, higher competition)

**Average CAC (Years 1-5):** €40

---

### 8.4 LTV:CAC Ratio

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average LTV** | €390 |
| **Average CAC** | €40 |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | **9.75:1** |

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- 3:1 = Acceptable
- 5:1 = Good
- 10:1+ = Excellent (MEMOIR achieves this)

**Payback Period:**
- CAC recovered after: €40 / €164.50 = **0.24 orders** = **3 months** (first purchase + typical time to refill consideration)

## 12. ASSUMPTIONS & RATIONALE

### 12.1 Revenue Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Year 1 Units** | 20,000 | Expert-only phase, limited distribution (10-20 stores), invite-only digital. Comparable: Le Labo's first year ~15K units. |
| **Year 2 Growth** | 5x | Open digital access, expand to 50 stores, subscription launch. Viral social media growth (TikTok discovery). |
| **Year 3 Growth** | 2.5x | Mass distribution (Sephora 100 stores), international expansion, Newcomer targeting. |
| **Year 4-5 Growth** | 1.5-1.8x | Market maturity, competition increases, growth moderates but remains strong. |
| **Average Price Decline** | -€35 over 5 years | Product mix shift: more refills (€120), subscription (€180), MEMOIR Signature (€150). Blended ASP drops from €220 to €185. |
| **Refill Rate** | 40% | Industry standard for luxury fragrance repeat purchase is 30-50%. MEMOIR's personalization drives higher loyalty. |
| **Subscription Adoption** | 10-15% by Year 3 | Comparable to subscription box adoption in beauty (5-20% range). |

---

### 12.2 Cost Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **COGS** | €45/unit (Year 1) | Fragrance liquid €18 + bottle €3 + cap €2 + labels €4.50 + packaging €10 + shipping €5 + labor €1 = €43.50, rounded to €45. |
| **COGS Decline** | -€3 over 5 years | Economies of scale: bulk material purchasing (-10%), production efficiency (+5%), shipping optimization (-5%). Year 5 COGS: €42/unit. |
| **Gross Margin** | 78-80% | Luxury fragrance standard: Chanel (85%), YSL (75-80%), Niche (70-75%). MEMOIR's tech adds value but slight COGS premium for customization. |
| **Fixed Cost Growth** | 50-80% YoY (Years 1-3) | Scaling team, marketing investment. Moderates in Years 4-5 (30-40% growth) as operational leverage kicks in. |
| **Marketing as % Revenue** | 23% (Year 1) → 8% (Year 5) | Year 1: Heavy brand-building investment. Years 2-5: Efficiency improves as brand awareness builds and organic growth increases. |
| **R&D Investment** | €2M (Year 1) → €3M (Year 5) | Year 1: Database build, platform. Years 2-3: Expansion to 500 mappings. Year 4-5: MEMOIR CHEMISTRY development. |

---

### 12.3 Customer Behavior Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **CAC** | €50 (Year 1) → €40 (avg) | Year 1: Influencer seeding, PR, events. Years 2+: Brand awareness + word-of-mouth reduce CAC. |
| **LTV** | €390 (4-year average) | Initial purchase (€220) + 40% refill rate (€48-120 over years) + 10-15% subscribe (€720/yr). Conservative estimate. |
| **Customer Lifespan** | 4 years | Fragrance customer churn: 25% annually. 4 years = 75% remain engaged. |
| **Repeat Purchase Rate** | 40% | Industry: 30-50%. MEMOIR's personalization + quality should drive upper end. |
| **NPS** | 90+ (Year 1) → 85+ (Years 2-5) | Expert phase: Curated experience, high satisfaction. Scaling: Maintain quality but slight moderation expected. |

---

### 12.4 Market Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **TAM** | €1.5-3B | Personalized luxury fragrance segment (5-10% of €30B total luxury fragrance market). Growing at 25-35% YoY. |
| **Market Penetration** | 2.5% (Year 3) → 5.9% (Year 5) | Realistic for premium niche brand. Le Labo: ~3% after 10 years. Byredo: ~4% after 15 years. MEMOIR's tech acceleration = faster. |
| **Competitive Dynamics** | Low (Years 1-3) → Medium (Years 4-5) | First-mover advantage, proprietary tech creates 2-3 year lead time. Copycats emerge Year 4+ but lack database depth. |
| **Economic Conditions** | Stable | Luxury fragrance is resilient: Covid-19 saw only -5% decline in 2020, +15% rebound 2021. Exception category even more resilient. |

---

### 12.5 Technology Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| **AI Accuracy** | 82% (perfumer approval) | Beta testing showed 82% of AI formulas approved or lightly edited by perfumers. Improves to 90%+ by Year 3 with ML. |
| **Database Scalability** | 50 → 500 mappings | Year 1: 50 core mappings (80% coverage). Year 2: 200 mappings (95%). Year 3+: 500 mappings (99% coverage). |
| **Platform Reliability** | 99.5% uptime | Standard for modern cloud infrastructure (AWS/Google Cloud). |
| **Production Turnaround** | 2-3 weeks | Modular accord system enables faster production than traditional bespoke (6-12 weeks). |

---

### 12.6 Risk Factors Considered

1. **Technology Risk:** AI may produce unsatisfactory formulas
   - **Mitigation:** Human perfumer review ensures quality (already in model)

2. **Market Risk:** Consumers may not value personalization at premium price
   - **Mitigation:** Year 1 validation with Experts before mass scaling

3. **Competitive Risk:** Dupes emerge faster than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Multi-layer undupability (database, perfumers, brand heritage)

4. **Execution Risk:** Production scaling challenges
   - **Mitigation:** Partner with Givaudan/IFF (proven scale capability)

5. **Economic Risk:** Recession impacts luxury spending
   - **Mitigation:** Exception category is resilient; personalization creates emotional value (less discretionary)
