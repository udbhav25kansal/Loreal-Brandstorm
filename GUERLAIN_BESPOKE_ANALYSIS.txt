BUSINESS MODEL
--------------

Price Point:        Starting at $130,000-$185,000 CAD
Scarcity:           Only a handful of clients per year
Ownership:          Lifetime exclusive formula rights
Partnership:        Co-branded with Moynat (LVMH leather goods)
Revenue Streams:    Initial creation + lifetime reorders


WHAT MAKES THEM SPECIAL
-----------------------

Heritage & Legitimacy
- 170+ years of bespoke tradition (since 1853)
- First bespoke fragrance created for Empress Eugénie's marriage to Napoleon III
- Not a new luxury play—authentic historical roots

The Perfumer
- Direct access to Thierry Wasser himself, not a junior perfumer
- "Fragrance is a language. A lot of people hear that language, but very few speak that language."

Philosophy of Hidden Luxury
- Wasser's insight: "To have something that is hidden and not really viewable is actually the new luxury"
- The ultimate anti-logo, anti-flex status symbol

The Package
- Custom Moynat trunk (two legendary French houses combined)
- 1-liter Golden Bee bottle hand-painted in fine gold
- 6 x 100mL sprays + 4 x 30mL travel bottles
- Optional personalization: initials and hand-painted colored stripes

Exclusivity Mechanics
- Your formula, no one else's—ever
- Cannot be replicated or sold to others
- Waiting lists create artificial scarcity and desirability


KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR BUSINESS MODEL
--------------------------------

1. Experience > Product: You're buying an 18-month journey with a master, not just a bottle
2. Lifetime Lock-in: Formula ownership ensures recurring revenue through reorders
3. Strategic Scarcity: Limited slots maintain exclusivity and pricing power
4. Heritage as Moat: 170-year history is impossible to replicate
5. Partnership Leverage: Moynat collaboration elevates perceived value beyond fragrance alone
