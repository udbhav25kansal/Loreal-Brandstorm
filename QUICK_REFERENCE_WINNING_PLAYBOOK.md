## THE 3-MINUTE WINNING STRUCTURE

### **OPENING (0:00-0:30) - THE HOOK**
**Goal**: Create immediate emotional investment

**Winner Techniques**:
- 🔥 **Kluben 2021**: "People used to shop TOGETHER, now they shop ALONE"
- 🔥 **Chile 2025**: "I went from sociable to unsociable...I couldn't go on like this"
- 🔥 **All Beauty 2022**: "Imagine waking up and everything you know how to do CHANGES"

**Formula**: Paradox OR Vulnerable Testimony OR Perspective Shift

❌ **NEVER DO**: Generic greeting, feature announcement, delayed hook

---

### **PROBLEM (0:30-1:00) - THE REFRAME**
**Goal**: Show you understand the ROOT CAUSE others miss

**Winner Techniques**:
- 🔥 **Chile**: "The real issue isn't hair falling out. It's men falling off the routine."
- 🔥 **Kluben**: Problem isn't e-commerce, it's LONELINESS
- 🔥 **All Beauty**: Problem isn't makeup products, it's APPLICATION TOOLS

**Formula**: Surface Problem → Real Problem (behavioral/emotional)

❌ **NEVER DO**: List features, focus only on functional gaps

---

### **SOLUTION (1:00-2:00) - THE ECOSYSTEM**
**Goal**: Show complete system through character using it

**Winner Techniques**:
- Show character journey (Hannah & Maria, Alex, etc.)
- Walk through ecosystem (Device + App + Community + Data)
- Demonstrate L'Oreal asset integration (ModiFace, Perso)
- Prove with data/user validation

**Formula**: Character USES solution → Transformation visible → Tech enables behavior

❌ **NEVER DO**: Feature dump, jargon overload, no character

---

### **BUSINESS (2:00-2:30) - THE MODEL**
**Goal**: Show clear path to recurring revenue

**Winner Models**:
- **Razor-Blade**: Device + refills (Chile, Rocket Paper Sisters)
- **Conversion**: Free integration, revenue through sales increase (Kluben)
- **Platform**: Free for L'Oreal, fee for others (Kluben expansion)

**Formula**: One-time sale (acquisition) + Recurring revenue (LTV) = Clear profitability

❌ **NEVER DO**: "Indirect benefits," vague monetization, no pricing

---

### **CLOSING (2:30-3:00) - THE HOPE**
**Goal**: Deliver unforgettable line that gives hope + action

**Winner Examples**:
- 🔥 **Chile**: "Your hair isn't gone. It's just waiting for instructions. So let's grow."
- 🔥 **Kluben**: "We bring back the FUN experience"
- 🔥 **All Beauty**: "When a person cannot express beauty freely...it means that was WRONG"

**Formula**: Hope + Empowerment + Collective Action ("Let's")

❌ **NEVER DO**: "Thank you," feature summary, no emotional payoff
