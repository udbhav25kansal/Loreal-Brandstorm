---

---

### BUT BOTH TARGETS ARE DRIVEN BY COMMON INTANGIBLE MOTIVATION: ELEVATION & DISTINCTION

**3 Major Ways to Seek Elevation:**

#### 1. Through UNIQUENESS 🇫🇷+
**Target:** Experts + Avant-Garde Connoisseurs

- Linked to **confidentiality** and feeling of wearing something **unique & refined**

---

#### 2. Through COMPLIMENTS 🇺🇸+
**Target:** Irresistible Enchanters

- **45% of American consumers** say they expect their exception fragrance to trigger compliments
- Compliments often imply **seduction power**

---

#### 3. Through STATUS 🇺🇸🇨🇳+
**Target:** Luxury Lovers + Avant-Garde Connoisseurs

- 🇨🇳 Wearing Exception means you have **education & knowledge**
- 🇺🇸 Highly linked to **"smell rich" trend** that suggests social achievement

---

**How Desire of Elevation Manifests Differently:**

| Country/Zone | Primary Elevation Path | Secondary Paths |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **France** | Uniqueness | - |
| **USA** | Compliments | Status |
| **China** | Status | - |

---

### 03 | AND A VERY TANGIBLE ONE: A ONE-OF-A-KIND JUICE

**The juice is the entry point to the category**

**Key Statistics:**
- **30%** of conversation on social media are about scent profiles and notes
- **29%** of virality is based on scent profiles
- **Top level technique** is a must-have

---

**Expert Consumers Look For:**
- Signature scents
- Unusual note combination
- Precious ingredients
- Technical performance
- **Olfactive accidents**

**Newcomer Consumers Look For:**
- An **"It-bag" scent**: luxury, statutory but still safe choice

---

**Perfumers' Perspective on Exception Juice:**

**What Makes a Killer Juice?**

✅ **All 12 perfumes** convey an **immediate message**: simple and qualitative olfactory message
- Can even be "raw": close to an accord (Baccarat Rouge and Santal 33)

✅ **Strong "partis pris"** - often an ingredient played in **overdose** that creates an **olfactive incident**

✅ **Deconstruction of classic pyramid** (top-heart-bottom)
- Not always immediate crush (vs prestige)
- Time must be given to **skin revelation**
- Crush may only appear at heart or/and bottom

✅ **Follow one direction** (memory, ingredient, emotions...)
- Keep this **red thread** along whole process
- **Few mods, simple story**, true to artistic pulse

---

**Different Segments Follow Different Creative Processes:**

**Pure Player Brands:**
- Can be more **polarizing, less consensual**
- Pure, extreme, radical
- Even non-identifiable to something already existing

**Couture Brands:**
- More **multi-layered and complex**
- Powerful notes, premium scents
- Less radical

---

**MAJOR INSIGHT:**

> Just like ready-to-wear is designed to meet most consumers' taste and expectations, prestige is designed to trigger immediate crush and massive approval. On the other hand, **exception is to fragrance what couture is to fashion**: the consumer comes here to be offered a **vision, result of a creative pulse**.

---

### 04 | SOPHISTICATED NARRATIVES ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO PROVIDE DREAM

**Conceptual Brands Outperform:**
- **1/3** of the offer
- **50%** of the business

**Emotional Territories are Both Identity and Aesthetics Driven:**

#### TRADITIONAL IMAGINARY (Identity):
- The Gentleman
- Femme Fatale
- Incense Temple
- Rich Family's Old Money Daughter
- British Royal Vibe

#### AESTHETICS IMAGINARY (Aesthetics):
- Coquette
- Clean & Cozy
- Girl Boss
- The Entrepreneur
- The Clean Boy
- Dark Academia
- Cool & Refresh Sensation

---

**MAJOR INSIGHT:**

> While Prestige meets the need of **archetyped incarnation**, Exception fulfills a **broader desire of imaginaire**.

---

### 05 | VIRALITY IS A NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT SUCCESS BOOSTER

**Virality Growth:** Exception fragrance is a fast-growing topic (**+740% 2023 vs 2021**)

**However:** Not all viral perfumes are necessarily best sellers (e.g., Gris Dior)

#### Virality vs. Sell-Out Comparison:

| Product | Sell-Out 2022 | TikTok Virality 2023 | Virality Rank |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Baccarat Rouge 540 - MFK | €121M | 543M | #1 |
| **Gris Dior** - Dior | **€0.1M** ⚠️ | **198M** | **#2** |
| Aventus - Creed | €79M | 133M | #3 |
| Santal 33 - Le Labo | €6M | 100M | #4 |
| Erba Pura - Xerjoff | €3.4M | 50M | #5 |
| Oud Wood - Tom Ford | €46M | 48M | #6 |
| Lazy Sunday Mornings - MM | €32M | 28M | #7 |
| Delina - Parfums de Marly | €29M | 19M | #8 |
| Bois d'Argent - Dior | €0.2M | 5M | #9 |

---

### VIRALITY FRAMEWORK:

#### ✅ VIRALITY MUST HAVES (Preconditions)
- **Scent Profile & Ingredients**
- **Aesthetic Territory**

#### 🟢 VIRALITY CONTRIBUTORS (The more the better)
- Fragrance Performance (Long lasting, Sillage, Strength)
- Evocative Name
- Eye Catching Packaging
- Price & Dupes
- Niche Brand Credentials

#### ⭐ VIRALITY BOOSTERS (Nice-to-haves, amplifying but not ensuring)
- **Celebrity & Influencer Endorsement**

---

**8 Drivers of Virality Identified:**

| Driver | % Mentions | Category |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Scent Profile** | 29% | Must Have |
| **Aesthetic Territories** | 24% | Must Have |
| **Long Lastingness** | 9% | Contributor |
| **Evocative Name** | 7% | Contributor |
| **Sillage** | 6% | Contributor |
| **Price** | 6% | Contributor |
| **Packaging** | 5% | Contributor |
| **Niche Brand Credentials** | 5% | Contributor |
| **Strength** | 5% | Contributor |
| **Celebrity/KOL Endorsement** | 4% | Booster |

---

**MAJOR INSIGHT:**

> **Virality is necessary but not sufficient.** Virality only amplifies propositions that adhere to the exceptional contract, which has for base an **exceptional juice**.
>
> Example: 'Missing Person' from Phlur was a failure due to its **short-term journey**, not designed to be enduring. **Time is required** for a creation to establish itself as the cornerstone of exceptional success.

---

### 06 | HOWEVER, POS EXPERIENCE KEEPS LAGGING BEHIND ALTHOUGH IT IS KEY FOR PERFUME DISCOVERY

#### Expert Consumers:

- Advice
- Knowledge
- Feeling of being **'special'**

✅ Look for **exceptional stores** they associate to **special destinations**

✅ Proud when they find the **"hidden treasure"** they'll make their signature scent

✅ Expect perfume advisor to **educate them and understand who they are**

---

#### Newcomer Consumers:
**They look for exceptional digital experiences**

✅ More inclined to **blind buy perfumes** discovered on social media

✅ Brands need to address need of **playful and emotional discovery** through:
- Samples
- Phygital experiences

---

### 07 | NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL RECIPE. EACH SUCCESS HAS ITS OWN MAGICAL, IMPONDERABLE DREAM FACTOR

**Success Components:**

#### 🎨 **ART OF THE JUICE**

---

**MAJOR INSIGHT:**

> **Success is a long-term journey:** whether it is about creation, consumer appreciation, skin revelation or virality, **time is the prevalent component** of a market success. Most of the 12 benches were not immediate successes. There is a challenge of the creative process and challenges in communication. Brands often need to choose between **fast sell-out** and **shooting star virality**.
