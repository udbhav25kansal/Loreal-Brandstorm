## STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Opening Hook (First 30 Seconds)
**KILLER OPENING** - Immediately identified core insight:
- **"COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation... L'Oreal saw 62% growth"**
- **Problem Hook**: "We're missing the aspect that made shopping entertaining: the experience with friends"
- **Contrast**: "We used to go to malls, try products, give recommendations... now we're in bed scrolling our laptop COMPLETELY ALONE"
- **Judgment**: "Isn't it weird that people used to go shopping TOGETHER but e-commerce is all about shopping ALONE?"

**Why This Works**:
✅ Immediate problem identification
✅ Emotional resonance (loneliness)
✅ Pandemic relevance (timely)
✅ Paradox creates tension ("together vs. alone")

### Problem Statement and Framing
**Brilliant Reframe**:
- Not "shopping is broken"
- But "we REMOVED THE FUN PART" from shopping
- Survey data: People prefer DIY + friend experience OVER professional treatments
- **Insight**: Friends' recommendations = #1 purchase driver in beauty (more powerful than influencers)

### Solution Reveal Timing
- **Perfect Timing**: 1:00 mark
- **Method**: Demo with Hannah & Maria use case
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Walked through user journey
  1. Create code
  2. Share with friend via social media
  3. Shared view of store
  4. Video call WHILE shopping
  5. Try on products together (ModiFace)
