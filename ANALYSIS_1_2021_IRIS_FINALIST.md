# 2021 FINALIST ANALYSIS: TEAM IRIS (Adria Balkan) - NOT WINNER

## PRESENTATION OVERVIEW
**Team**: Iris by L'Oreal (Adria Balkan - Croatia)
**Product**: Iris Mobile Makeup - Mobile app and makeup collection for visually impaired people
**Result**: Finalist (Not Winner)

---

## STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Opening Hook (First 30 Seconds)
- **Approach**: Personal greeting ("we are so happy to see you")
- **Hook Quality**: Weak - Generic greeting, no immediate tension or problem
- **Delayed Impact**: Problem statement came 30 seconds in, not immediately
- **Missed Opportunity**: Should have opened with "253 million visually impaired people are excluded from makeup"

### Problem Statement and Framing
- **Problem Definition**: Clear and emotional - "what if someone missed out on the fun that makeup brings"
- **Statistics Used**: 39M fully blind + 253M visually impaired globally
- **Urgency**: Future projection - "number will triple in next 30 years"
- **Quote Usage**: Ellen (famous blind YouTuber) - "makeup is and should be something for all of us to enjoy"
- **Market Opportunity**: Framed as massive untapped community

### Solution Reveal Timing
- **Timing**: 1:30 into presentation (too slow)
- **Method**: Sequential feature explanation
- **Technology**: ModiFace face scanning + voice assistant integration
- **Product Line**: Iris app + Iris makeup collection with unique packaging

### Evidence and Proof Points
**Technology Foundation**:
- ModiFace technology (existing L'Oreal asset)
- Voice assistant integration
- Virtual try-on room
- In-app purchasing

**Product Design**:
- Braille labels on packaging
- Octagonal shape lipsticks for stability
- Palette shades from lighter to darker
- Shortened mascara brush for precision

**Data Strategy**:
- Three data types: personal, engagement, behavioral
- Personalization loop

**Revenue Model**:
- Free app (accessibility focus)
- Revenue from collection sales
- Donations to visually impaired community

### Call to Action / Closing
- **Quote**: "She blooms even when darkness sings" (poetic but unclear)
- **Final Message**: "just because someone is visually impaired doesn't mean beauty does not exist for them"
- **Weakness**: No specific ask or next steps for L'Oreal

---

## EMOTIONAL APPEALS

### Primary Emotions Triggered
1. **Empathy** (strongest) - For excluded community
2. **Inspiration** - Inclusive mission
3. **Pride** - Doing good for society
4. **Guilt** - Beauty industry has excluded people

### Personal Stories / Human Elements
- **Ellen Quote**: Authentic voice of community
- **Association Feedback**: Contact with Croatian blind association, positive response from women
- **Weakness**: No specific user testimonial or story arc

### Passion and Conviction
- **Delivery**: Nervous but sincere
- **Authenticity**: Clear genuine care for the cause
- **Team Dynamic**: Collaborative answer style during Q&A

### Connection to Judges' Values
- **L'Oreal Values**: Inclusion, technology, data collection

- **Tech Integration**: ModiFace leverage shows internal synergy

---

## BUSINESS LOGIC

### Market Opportunity Sizing
- **TAM**: 253M+ visually impaired people globally
- **Growth**: Will triple in 30 years
- **Weakness**: No revenue projections, no market share estimates
- **Weakness**: No regional launch strategy

### Competitive Advantage Articulation
- **First Mover**: "L'Oreal can be the first global makeup brand for blind people"
- **Technology**: ModiFace integration
- **Design**: Purpose-built packaging and products
- **Weakness**: No competitive landscape analysis

### Feasibility Demonstration
**Strengths**:
- Existing L'Oreal tech (ModiFace)
- User validation (association feedback)
- Clear product design principles

**Weaknesses**:
- No technical implementation timeline
- No cost structure
- No manufacturing considerations for specialized packaging

### Scalability Proof
- **Global Market**: Addressed worldwide opportunity
- **Platform Play**: App can scale globally
- **Product Line Extension**: Multiple product types
- **Weakness**: No phased rollout plan
- **Weakness**: No logistics for specialized packaging at scale

### Financial Projections
**Critical Weakness**: None provided
- No pricing strategy detailed
- No unit economics
- No profitability timeline
- Only mentioned "indirect benefits" like brand identity

---

## STORYTELLING STYLE

### Narrative Arc
- **Type**: Problem-Solution with Social Impact
- **Arc Quality**: Linear but not compelling
- **Structure**: Problem → Statistics → Solution Features → Values
- **Weakness**: No hero's journey, no transformation story

### Use of Metaphors and Analogies
- **Limited Usage**: Very literal presentation
- **Poetry Attempt**: "She blooms even when darkness sings" (forced, unclear)
- **Missed Opportunity**: Could have used "seeing beauty differently" concept

### Pacing and Rhythm
- **Speed**: Moderate, no urgency
- **Energy**: Steady but low
- **Variation**: Minimal - needed more dynamics
- **Time Management**: Used full 3 minutes efficiently

### Visual Language and Imagery
- **App Demo**: Clear functional walkthrough
- **Product Design**: Specific tactile descriptions
- **Weakness**: No compelling visual story or imagery in words

---

## UNIQUE ELEMENTS

### What Makes THIS Pitch Distinctive?
1. **Underserved Market**: Visually impaired makeup users (unique focus)
2. **Dual Product**: App + Physical collection integration
3. **CSR Integration**: Donation model built in
4. **Design Innovation**: Braille, shapes, packaging for blind users

### Innovation Presentation Approach
- **Style**: Feature-list approach (weak)
- **Demo**: Verbal walkthrough with slides
- **Differentiation**: Accessibility technology integration

### Memorable Moments or Phrases
- **"We are so happy to see you"**: Ironic opening (unintentional?)
- **Ellen Quote**: Authentic voice moment
- **"She blooms even when darkness sings"**: Poetic attempt (confusing)
- **Overall**: No truly memorable "aha" moment

### Risk-Taking vs Playing It Safe
- **Safe Territory**: Inclusion is accepted L'Oreal priority
- **Moderate Risk**: Niche market could be seen as too small
- **Safe Tech**: Using existing ModiFace (low risk)
- **Safe Monetization**: Traditional product sales model
