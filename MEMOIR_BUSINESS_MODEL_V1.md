# MEMOIR Business Model - Version 1
## Initial Revision Based on Team Discussion

---

## THE CONCEPT

**MEMOIR** is a luxury custom fragrance service that transforms personal memories into bespoke perfumes using AI-powered scent translation, crafted by Master Perfumers.

**Tagline**: *Your memories, bottled.*

---

## THE 3-STEP JOURNEY

### Step 1: DISCOVER
**Create Your Scent Profile + Share Your Memory**

The customer downloads the MEMOIR app and completes:

**A. Scent Profile Quiz (5 minutes)**
- Simple preference questions using everyday language
- "Do you prefer the smell of fresh laundry or warm vanilla?"
- "Beach morning or forest afternoon?"
- "Light and airy or rich and cozy?"
- Establishes baseline preferences: Sweet, Floral, Fresh, Woody, Musky

**B. Memory Upload**
- Upload 1-3 photos of the memory to capture
- Add optional voice note describing the moment
- Select memory category: Celebration, Place, Person, Season, Milestone

**Why This Works**: The profile ensures the final fragrance aligns with what the customer actually likes, while the memory provides the unique character.

### Step 2: TRANSLATE
**AI Analyzes & Perfumer Interprets**

**A. AI Analysis**
- MEMOIR AI scans uploaded images for visual cues:
  - Environment (beach, garden, city, indoor)
  - Colors (warm tones, cool tones, vibrant, muted)
  - Elements (flowers, water, food, people, textures)
  - Season/time indicators
- Cross-references with scent profile preferences
- Generates an "Olfactive Blueprint" - a visual map of suggested notes

**B. Human Interpretation**
- Master Perfumer reviews the AI blueprint + customer inputs
- Creates 3 sample variations:
  - True to Memory (closest to AI interpretation)
  - Balanced Blend (memory + preferences weighted equally)
  - Wearable Daily (preferences-forward, memory as accent)

**Why This Works**: AI provides data-driven starting point; human expertise ensures quality and nuance. Three options give customer control.

### Step 3: CREATE
**Sample, Approve, Receive**

**A. Sample Delivery (Week 1-2)**
- 3 sample vials (2ml each) delivered to customer
- Each labeled with notes breakdown
- Includes scent testing guide

**B. Customer Selection**
- Customer wears each sample for 2-3 days
- Selects favorite OR requests adjustments
- Can schedule video consultation with perfumer if needed

**C. Final Creation & Delivery (Week 3-4)**
- Full bottle (50ml or 100ml) created
- Custom bottle features:
  - Memory photo printed on bottle
  - QR code linking to digital memory album
  - Certificate of authenticity
- Delivered in luxury packaging

**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks total
**Price Point**: $350-500 (positioning between mass luxury and haute parfumerie)

## ADDRESSING KEY CONCERNS

### "What if they don't like the final fragrance?"
**Solution**: 3-sample system + adjustment option + video consultation ensures approval before final creation.

### "How is AI actually useful?"
**Solution**: AI does what humans can't - translate visual data to olfactive notes at scale. It's the bridge between a photo and a formula. Without AI, customers would need to articulate scent preferences themselves (which they can't).

### "Is this scalable?"
**Solution**: AI handles the analysis at scale. Perfumers work from standardized note libraries. L'Oreal's existing supply chain handles ingredients. Only the final mixing is truly custom.

### "How is this different from existing custom fragrance services?"
**Solution**: Existing services rely on customer describing what they want (hard). MEMOIR lets you SHOW what you want (easy). Photo-to-fragrance is the innovation.

- **Packaging**: Refillable bottle system - return for 20% discount on next creation

---

## INCLUSIVITY INTEGRATION

- **Universal Memory**: Everyone has memories worth preserving
